0) Prep (5 quick moves)
Open your repo in Cursor.
Create a new branch mvp-launch.
Decide your single CTA now: Book a 15-minute call (https://calendly.com/elias-scrapyardsites/30min) — everything funnels to this.
Keep only 4 nav items: Home · Pricing · About · Contact (+ a CTA button on the right).
Hide/delete anything half-built (calculators, demo placeholders, WIP pages).

1) Header cleanup
Put your phone top-right and make it tap-to-call: tel:+1 (949) 356-8762.
Add one CTA button: “Book a 15-min Call”.
Remove any secondary CTAs (“Pay deposit” stays only on Pricing).
Microcopy (header tagline under logo, optional):
Websites that turn scrap into calls.


2) Hero: clarity above the fold
Replace your current hero with the three lines below + CTA button.
Hero H1:
Scrapyard websites that drive more calls and loads
Subhead (2 lines):
Built by a scrap-industry insider. Launch in 7–10 days with a clear materials list, fast quote forms, and tap-to-call on every page.
Primary CTA: Book a 15-minute call
Secondary (text link only): See pricing

3) Proof wedge (just below hero)
Add one short bar with 3–4 credibility points:
Industry experience in yards & metals
7–10 day launch window
Mobile-first, sub-2s load time
90-day warm-lead guarantee

4) Packages (skim-friendly)
Keep just two cards: Standard and Premium. Each card: price, 5 bullets, one button.
Standard – $2,499 + $99/mo
Tap-to-call header & sticky mobile actions
“Materials we accept” page (fewer bad leads)
Quote/Contact forms wired to your inbox
Google Business Profile basics (N/A if you don’t offer — remove)
Hosting, SSL, backups, updates
Premium – $5,499 + $199/mo
Everything in Standard
Multi-location, multi-materials pages
Hiring funnel (short app w/ file upload)
Photo galleries & reviews embed
Monthly content updates (N/A if not offered — remove)
Card button (both): Book a 15-minute call
Keep Pay Deposit as a small link (https://book.stripe.com/eVqeVd8Vi9U45RbdJy73G00).

5) Guarantee (define it simply)
Add a small block under Pricing:
90-Day Warm-Lead Guarantee
If you don’t see a measurable increase in warm inquiries (calls with ≥20s duration or completed quote forms) within 90 days of launch, I’ll work at no charge until you do.
Add a tiny “What counts?” tooltip or footnote:
Warm lead = call ≥20s or submitted form with name + phone
We measure via your call logs and form submissions

6) “How it works” (3 steps)
1) Discovery (15 min): we pick pages, materials, and brand basics.
2) Build (7–10 days): I draft copy, configure forms, and wire your phone.
3) Launch & tune: we go live, check call/form flow, and adjust in week 1.

7) About (your insider edge)
Two short paragraphs. Use this:
I work in scrap and metals operations. I’ve built this offering around what yards actually need: fast mobile access, clear materials lists that reduce tire-kickers, and quote forms that reach the right person the first time.
I ship quickly, I answer the phone, and I measure results in calls and loads—not pageviews.

8) Contact section (keep simple)
Wire the existing Schedule My 15 Minute Scan button to a formsubmit link that sends to hello@scrapyardsites.com and skip the honeypot redirect, directing to the calendy link in step 0 after it submits. This should also apply to the contact section on the home page.

9) Navigation + footer tidy
Nav: Home, Pricing, About, Contact, [Book Call].
Footer: phone (tap-to-call), email (mailto), brief services list, and the same Book Call button.

10) Consistency pass (find/replace)
In Cursor:
Find: “Book”, “Schedule”, “Deposit”, “Demo”, “Calculator”
Fix: make every CTA read “Book a 15-minute call”
Remove/hide any page or link that isn’t complete

11) Tracking & SEO basics (fast wins)
Title tag: Scrapyard Sites — Your competition has a website. Do you?
Meta description: Launch a scrapyard website in 7–10 days. Materials pages, tap-to-call, quote forms, and a 90-day warm-lead guarantee.
Open Graph image: use your logo or a simple banner; set og:title, og:description.
If you already run analytics, keep it; if not, skip for MVP (add later).

12) Mobile QA (do this before you ship)
On your phone:
Does the header phone tap-to-call?
Does the Book Call button go to Calendly?
Are fonts and buttons large enough?
Scroll each page: any broken links or unfinished sections?
Forms (if any): submit a test; confirm email receipt.

13) Ship
Commit mvp-launch → merge to main → deploy.
Load the live site in an incognito window and on your phone one more time.
