        <p class="text-zinc-700">
          I work in scrap and metals operations. I’ve built this offering around what yards actually need: fast mobile access, clear materials lists that reduce tire-kickers, and quote forms that reach the right person the first time.
        </p>
        <p class="text-zinc-700">
          I ship quickly, I answer the phone, and I measure results in calls and loads—not pageviews.
